How I built the Memory Game
After following the JScourses on Udacity,
I build this game with JS,CSS and HTML.

The game has
 a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed
 a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of the game.
 added effects to cards when they match
 create a pop-up modal when player finds all the pokemon.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
