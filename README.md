If all cards are matched you can see your ranking and time.

- 2 stars - less then  30 moves

You can restart the game to play again.
Have fun playing my  matching game!





## Why I made the Memory Game and what is in it.

After following the JScourses on Udacity,
I build this project as part of the nanodegree course with JS,CSS and HTML.

The game has
 -a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed.
 -a timer to know how long it took to find al the matches.
 -a rating with stars for the moves and matches found.
 -added effects to cards when they match.
 -a pop-up modal when player finds all the pokemon with your scores.
